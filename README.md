Notes on Machine Learning and data mining in aerospace technology.

> These are not notes persay, but more so concepts that i was some what confused by which required me to get a further
understanding on. This book has some rather interesting concepts which i had not come across.

If you have some general machine learning knowledge this should be a nice little guidance or little further information
regarding what this is on about.

The book is referencing :
>Aboul Ella Hassanien
> Ashraf Darwish
> Hesham El-Askary Editors
> Machine Learning and Data Mining
> in Aerospace Technology
